   User Guide for Running the Interpreter
############################################

Mode 1: Running the Interpreter from a File
Preparing the File:
Ensure the file contains the code you want to execute.
Save the file in a text format (e.g., .txt or .py).
Running the Interpreter:
Open the Command Prompt or Terminal.
Navigate to the directory where your file is located using the cd command.
Run the interpreter with the file using the command:
python interpreter.py <filename>
For example:
python interpreter.py myscript.txt

Mode 2: Running the Interpreter in Interactive Mode
Starting the Interpreter:
Open the Command Prompt or Terminal.
Navigate to the directory where the interpreter.py file is located using the cd command.
Start the interpreter using the command:
python interpreter.py

Using Interactive Mode:
After starting the interpreter, you can type commands directly and see the results immediately.
For example, you can type:
VAR x = 10
PRINT(x)

The interpreter will execute the commands and display the result.
Examples of Using the Interpreter
Example of Running a File
Suppose you have a file named example.txt with the following content:

VAR x = 5
VAR y = 10
PRINT(x + y)

To run the file, use the command:

python interpreter.py example.txt

The output will be:

15

Example of Using Interactive Mode
After starting the interpreter in interactive mode, you can type commands like:

VAR name = "John"
PRINT("Hello, " + name + "!")

The output will be:

Hello, John!
